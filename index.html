	<i>TIRCIS</i> (Thermal InfraRed Compact Imaging Spectrometer) is a long wave thermal hyperspectral imaging system. This is a variable-gap Fabry Perot interferometer providing several bands in the 8-14 micron region of the em spectrum. The instrument consists of an uncooled microbolometer, lenses, the interferometer and blackbody paddles which can be cooled and heated to controlled temperatures, and then positioned in or out of the optical path. </p>
<p>A typical data collection will consist of a cold (relative to target's temperature) blackbody scan, a hot (relative to target) blackbody scan, and then the target scan. The target scan will be numerous frames with the objects in the scene moving across the interferometer. The purpose of the software is to take these components of the input data and produce a hyperspectral cube in radiance, emissivity and temperature space. Major procedures in the process include the reformatting of the scan data by resampling subsequent frames into a cube in which a point in the scene is now contained at each position in the interferometer,i.e. the line in the resulting frame represents the interferogram for a point in the imaged scene.  This allows for the processing of interferograms from the two blackbodies and the interferogram of a target extracted from the reformatted cube.
